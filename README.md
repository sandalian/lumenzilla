### Triple P60 Drop-Ins Dimension
This is my measurement for already made triple [P60](http://flashlightwiki.com/P60) LED drop-ins, tested on some P60 hosts (Surefire P60, Solarforce L2M, Solarforce L2T). 

Works with 20mm optics (triple), 20mm MPCB, and 17mm LED drivers. It can accomodate optics with 7mm height and drivers with maximum 9mm heights (including components).

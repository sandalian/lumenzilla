### 1. Triple P60 Drop-Ins Dimension
This is my measurement for already made triple [P60](http://flashlightwiki.com/P60) LED drop-ins, tested on some P60 hosts (Surefire P60, Solarforce L2M, Solarforce L2T). Not fits in Malkoff's hosts.

__Suitable Parts:__
- Ø 20mm optics (triple), height max 7mm
- Ø 20mm MPCB
- Ø 17mm LED drivers (perhaps need a little sanding) 

It can accomodate drivers with maximum 9mm heights (including components).

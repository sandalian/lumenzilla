## 1. Triple P60 Drop-Ins Dimension
This is my measurement for already made triple [P60](http://flashlightwiki.com/P60) LED drop-ins, tested on P60 hosts (Surefire and Solarforce). 

Works with 20mm optics (triple), 20mm MPCB, and 17mm LED drivers. It can accomodate optics with 7mm height and drivers with maximum 9mm total heights.
